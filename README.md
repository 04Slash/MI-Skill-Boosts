# MI-Skill-Boosts
Shows every item, consumable, agility course and POI that boost non-combat skills as well as any missing dungeon pets or purchases. Allows you to quickly Equip Items, Build Obstacles, Travel to POIs, or make Shop Purchases.

Background explanations and other information can be found in-game by hovering over the ( i ). The TL;DR is Green = Equipped/Built, Yellow = Lacking Costs, Red = Item not owned/Requirements not met, Default = Can Equip/Build/Buy, Light Blue = Filtered (Only when filter mode is enabled). Small Gear = Item in Passive Slot. Small X = Obstacle is not Active.

Has Support for [Myth] Music. Any modded item that uses base game modifiers will be automatically supported by this mod. If features are not working correctly with modded content, ensure Skill Boosts is under the other mods in the mod load order.

In Ancient Relics, any preservation and doubling items will be hidden if they do not have any other useful modifiers.

This mod is translated to every language that is supported by the base game with the help of Google Translate (en, zh-CN, zh-TW, fr, de, it, ko, ja, pt, pt-br, es, ru, tr). If any improvements can be made to these translations, please feel free to let me know and I will update them.

Suggestions and bug reports can be sent to @slahsh on discord either directly or in the #mod-bug-reports channel (tag me!). Commenting on [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/skill-boosts) also works. This github will not be checked and thus should not be used to report bugs. This repository was made as an easier way to view the mod's code.
